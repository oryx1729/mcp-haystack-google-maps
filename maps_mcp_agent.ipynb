The servers were also nice and friendly.\",\\\\n      \"time\": 1539521462,\\\\n      \"translated\": false\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"author_name\": \"mike dunn\",\\\\n      \"author_url\": \"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100914204389621236550/reviews\",\\\\n      \"language\": \"en\",\\\\n      \"original_language\": \"en\",\\\\n      \"profile_photo_url\": \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWOsa299k4Brs4ODw3sSRIvXSVeKV4MJ8pYL4xHZ0bGLUG8nZF0oA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4\",\\\\n      \"rating\": 5,\\\\n      \"relative_time_description\": \"8 months ago\",\\\\n      \"text\": \"Was recommended by my friend and he wasn\\\\\\'t wrong , the food was first class\",\\\\n      \"time\": 1721405632,\\\\n      \"translated\": false\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \"opening_hours\": {\\\\n    \"open_now\": true,\\\\n    \"periods\": [\\\\n      {\\\\n        \"close\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 1,\\\\n          \"time\": \"0000\"\\\\n        },\\\\n        \"open\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 0,\\\\n          \"time\": \"1200\"\\\\n        }\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \"close\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 2,\\\\n          \"time\": \"0000\"\\\\n        },\\\\n        \"open\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 1,\\\\n          \"time\": \"1600\"\\\\n        }\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \"close\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 4,\\\\n          \"time\": \"0000\"\\\\n        },\\\\n        \"open\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 3,\\\\n          \"time\": \"1200\"\\\\n        }\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \"close\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 5,\\\\n          \"time\": \"0000\"\\\\n        },\\\\n        \"open\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 4,\\\\n          \"time\": \"1200\"\\\\n        }\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \"close\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 6,\\\\n          \"time\": \"0000\"\\\\n        },\\\\n        \"open\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 5,\\\\n          \"time\": \"1200\"\\\\n        }\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \"close\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 0,\\\\n          \"time\": \"0000\"\\\\n        },\\\\n        \"open\": {\\\\n          \"day\": 6,\\\\n          \"time\": \"1200\"\\\\n        }\\\\n      }\\\\n    ],\\\\n    \"weekday_text\": [\\\\n      \"Monday: 4:00\\\\u202fPM\\\\u2009–\\\\u200912:00\\\\u202fAM\",\\\\n      \"Tuesday: Closed\",\\\\n      \"Wednesday: 12:00\\\\u202fPM\\\\u2009–\\\\u200912:00\\\\u202fAM\",\\\\n      \"Thursday: 12:00\\\\u202fPM\\\\u2009–\\\\u200912:00\\\\u202fAM\",\\\\n      \"Friday: 12:00\\\\u202fPM\\\\u2009–\\\\u200912:00\\\\u202fAM\",\\\\n      \"Saturday: 12:00\\\\u202fPM\\\\u2009–\\\\u200912:00\\\\u202fAM\",\\\\n      \"Sunday: 12:00\\\\u202fPM\\\\u2009–\\\\u200912:00\\\\u202fAM\"\\\\n    ]\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\', annotations=None)] isError=False', origin=ToolCall(tool_name='maps_place_details', arguments={'place_id': 'ChIJM3h7WV9SqEcRImqASWZe4jM'}, id='call_RRDsBsX8WGCxKMj7iaUZHxA6'), error=False)]\n",
